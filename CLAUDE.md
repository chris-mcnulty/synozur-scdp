# Constellation - Synozur Consulting Delivery Platform (SCDP)

## What This App Is
A comprehensive consulting project lifecycle platform: estimation, resource allocation, time tracking, expense management, and automated invoice generation. Multi-tenant SaaS for consulting firms.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, Radix UI / shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript (ES modules), RESTful API
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon)
- **PDF**: Puppeteer

## Project Structure
- Monorepo: `/client`, `/server`, `/shared`

## Critical Rules
- **FONT**: ONLY use **Avenir Next Lt Pro** family. NEVER use Inter, system-ui, or any other font. Font files in `client/public/fonts/`. CSS `@font-face` and Tailwind `fontFamily` must point to `'Avenir Next LT Pro'`.
- **Assets**: `attached_assets/` is ONLY for temporary scratch files. NEVER store permanent assets there. Use `client/src/assets/logos/` etc.
- **User Model**: Multi-tenant — a user in one tenant can be a client in another. NO separate client_contacts table. Use the existing `users` table for all people.
- **User Management UI**: Single unified view (like Vega), NOT separate admin pages. Scope-based filtering, not separate "Platform Users" vs "Tenant Users" pages.

## Auth
- **Production**: Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID) SSO
- **Development**: Local email/password
- **Roles**: Six-tier hierarchy with feature-based permissions
- **Platform Roles**: `global_admin` and `constellation_admin` for cross-tenant management

## Multi-Tenancy
- UUID-based tenant IDs, data isolation, subdomain routing
- Global `users` table + `tenant_users` for tenant-specific access/roles
- Auto-assignment on login
- Tenant-specific settings, branding, and vocabulary

## Document Storage
- Multi-tier: SharePoint Embedded (primary) + Replit Object Storage (legacy fallback)
- Tenant opt-in via `speStorageEnabled` flag
- Per-tenant Azure AD isolation for file operations
- SPE billing to Synozur, not customers

## Planning & Documentation Files (READ BEFORE PLANNING WORK)
When planning new features, enhancements, or prioritizing work, ALWAYS consult these files first:
- **`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`** — The canonical user guide (v1.7). Describes all features, workflows, roles, and integrations from the user's perspective. Use this to understand how features should behave and to keep new work consistent with documented behavior. Also mirrored at `client/public/docs/USER_GUIDE.md` for in-app access. Detailed guides in `docs/user-guide/`.
- **`backlog.md`** — The product backlog (v5.0). Lists completed items, in-progress work, and prioritized future items. Check this BEFORE starting any new feature to avoid duplicating work or conflicting with planned items. Update it when completing backlog items.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — The strategic product roadmap. Covers vision, quarterly priorities (Q1/Q2 2026), medium-term goals (H2 2026), and long-term vision (2027+). Use this to understand strategic direction and ensure new work aligns with product priorities.
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** — Release history. Reference when tracking what shipped and when.

## Communication Style
Simple, everyday language.
