Findings

The Stack Ranking module, based on Borda scores, revealed a clear preference for ideas addressing Accounting Integration and Status Reporting. The top-ranked idea, 'Integration into QuickBooks for Consultants,' received the highest marketplace coin allocation (94 coins), indicating a strong consensus on its importance. Enhanced Status Reporting also demonstrated high support, reflecting the cohort's interest in AI-driven efficiency enhancements.

Marketplace Allocation data indicated that participants focused their 'coins' on ideas they believed would deliver the highest value, with a notable preference for high-impact ideas despite their associated effort. The two QuickBooks-related integration ideas (Accounting Integration and Tool Integrations) collectively received significant attention, emphasizing the importance of accounting and financial interoperability.

The 2x2 Priority Matrix provided additional insights into the perceived feasibility and impact of the ideas. Notably, 'Fix the export PDF bug for expense reports' was identified as high impact with low effort, making it a likely quick win. Conversely, the top-ranked QuickBooks integration idea scored high on both impact and effort, suggesting that while it is a high-priority initiative, it may require substantial resources to implement.

There was limited diversity in the types of improvements proposed, as most ideas focused on integrations, automation, and bug fixes. Categories like Role Definitions and Alerts & Notifications received lower prioritization, potentially reflecting a lower perceived urgency or alignment with current organizational goals.
