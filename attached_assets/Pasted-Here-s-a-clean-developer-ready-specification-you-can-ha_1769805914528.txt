Here’s a clean, developer‑ready specification you can hand directly to your engineer building the **Synozur → QuickBooks Online Invoice Export**. Everything below is based on the exact rules QuickBooks Online enforces for invoice imports.

***

# **QuickBooks Online – Invoice Export Specification (Developer Version)**

## 1. **Required Invoice Fields**

Your exported CSV **must** contain these columns exactly, because QBO will reject imports missing them:

*   **Invoice Number**
*   **Customer**
*   **Invoice Date**
*   **Due Date**
*   **Item Amount**    [\[digitalass...intuit.com\]](https://digitalasset.intuit.com/DOCUMENT/A5EA0szyV/import-invoices-quickbooks-online-guide.pdf), [\[uploads.te...blecdn.com\]](https://uploads.teachablecdn.com/attachments/1171e689f9a94a83b860c212ae0104d2.pdf)

QBO uses the *first row for mapping only* and will not import it.    [\[quickbooks...intuit.com\]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-ca/help-article/import-export-files/common-questions-importing-data-quickbooks-online/L4OYJRFdj_CA_en_CA)

***

## 2. **Optional / Common Fields (Recommended for a Robust Export)**

While not required, these significantly improve accuracy and reduce manual correction:

**Invoice-Level Fields**

*   **Terms**
*   **Billing Address**
*   **Shipping Address**
*   **Memo / Notes**
*   **Custom Transaction Number toggle** (must be ON if we want to preserve Invoice Numbers)    [\[digitalass...intuit.com\]](https://digitalasset.intuit.com/DOCUMENT/A5EA0szyV/import-invoices-quickbooks-online-guide.pdf)

**Line-Level Fields (repeat per line)**

*   **Product/Service (Item)**
*   **Description**
*   **Quantity**
*   **Rate**
*   **Amount** (QBO uses this as the authority field)
*   **Tax Code** (if applicable)

***

## 3. **Name Matching Rules (Critical for Success)**

For customers, products, services, and categories:

*   All names **must match QuickBooks Online display names exactly**.
*   If the CSV references a customer or item not in QBO, QBO can create customers *only if* the “Add new customers” checkbox is enabled on import.    [\[digitalass...intuit.com\]](https://digitalasset.intuit.com/DOCUMENT/A5EA0szyV/import-invoices-quickbooks-online-guide.pdf)

***

## 4. **Row & File Size Limits**

*   Maximum **1,000 rows per CSV**.
*   If we exceed this in batch exports, break into multiple files programmatically.    [\[digitalass...intuit.com\]](https://digitalasset.intuit.com/DOCUMENT/A5EA0szyV/import-invoices-quickbooks-online-guide.pdf)

***

## 5. **Custom Invoice Numbers**

If we want the invoice number generated by Synozur’s SCDP/OS to pass through:

*   Enable **“Custom transaction numbers”** in QBO account settings.
*   Otherwise, QBO **will overwrite** the Invoice Number with its own sequence.    [\[digitalass...intuit.com\]](https://digitalasset.intuit.com/DOCUMENT/A5EA0szyV/import-invoices-quickbooks-online-guide.pdf)

***

## 6. **Currency & Date Format**

*   QBO accepts **CSV, XLS, XLSX, or Google Sheets**, but CSV is recommended.
*   Must explicitly set date formats at mapping time (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD`).    [\[uploads.te...blecdn.com\]](https://uploads.teachablecdn.com/attachments/1171e689f9a94a83b860c212ae0104d2.pdf)

***

## 7. **Line Grouping Rules (Multi‑Line Invoices)**

To keep multi-line invoices together:

*   Every line belonging to the same invoice must use **the same Invoice Number** value for grouping.
*   This is required for QBO and third-party importers.    [\[tprosuppor...tworks.com\]](https://tprosupport.rightworks.com/kb/article/880-import-invoices-into-quickbooks-online/)

***

## 8. **Products & Services Structure**

If your file references hierarchical items:

*   Use the `Parent:Sub-Item` format with **no spaces** around the colon.  
    Example: `Consulting:AI Strategy`
*   This applies both to Customer:Job and Item:Sub-Item.    [\[tprosuppor...tworks.com\]](https://tprosupport.rightworks.com/kb/article/880-import-invoices-into-quickbooks-online/)

***

## 9. **Unsupported Elements**

QBO will reject or break imports containing:

*   Negative values that imply credits
*   Missing products or services without fallbacks
*   Invalid date formats
*   WordArt, embedded assets, oversized files (>2MB) when using DOCX importers (not relevant for CSV but good to note)

## 10. **Developer-Friendly CSV Schema (Recommended)**

    Invoice Number,Customer,Invoice Date,Due Date,Product/Service,Description,Qty,Rate,Item Amount,Tax Code,Memo
    INV-1001,Acme Corp,2026-01-30,2026-02-14,AI Strategy,Workshop facilitation,8,400,3200,TAXABLE,"January Strategy Session"
    INV-1001,Acme Corp,2026-01-30,2026-02-14,UX Research,Discovery Interviews,5,250,1250,TAXABLE,""

This structure ensures:

*   Invoice‑level fields repeat per line (QBO merges automatically)
*   Line items are differentiated correctly
*   Grouping is stable

## 11. **Import Process (for QA Testing)**

To validate your export before shipping code:

1.  Go to **Settings → Import Data → Invoices**
2.  Click **Download sample CSV** (to validate format and headers)
3.  Upload your generated CSV and map fields
4.  Review & confirm import results    [\[uploads.te...blecdn.com\]](https://uploads.teachablecdn.com/attachments/1171e689f9a94a83b860c212ae0104d2.pdf)

***

## 12. **Developer Summary (Copy/Paste)**

**Your export must:**

*   Output CSV ≤ 1,000 rows
*   Include required fields (Invoice Number, Customer, Invoice Date, Due Date, Item Amount)
*   Repeat invoice-level fields on every line
*   Preserve Invoice Number exactly and rely on grouping
*   Match all names exactly to QBO values
*   Use consistent date formatting
*   Break batches >1,000 lines
*   Avoid negative/unsupported data

**Your export should:**

*   Include Product/Service, Description, Qty, Rate, Amount per line
*   Support hierarchical items via `Parent:Child`
*   Ensure numeric values are raw (no currency symbols)

If you want, I can also produce a **JSON schema**, a **TypeScript interface**, or a **sample batch export** for SCDP that matches your internal objects (Client, Role/Service, Expense, etc.).
