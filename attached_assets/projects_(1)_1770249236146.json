With generative AI and Copilot reshaping enterprise content management, Reveille sought to refine its positioning and outreach to customers, partners, and Microsoft stakeholders. Synozur led the development of a new Marketing and Positioning Framework (MPF), grounded in competitive research, stakeholder interviews, and targeted testing across Microsoft and partner audiences. This included crafting concise, differentiated messaging, building enablement programs for Microsoft channels (GBBs, Innovation Hubs, SSPs), and launching tailored engagement strategies for systems integrators and managed service providers. The initiative culminated in a data-backed MPF and campaign blueprint designed to drive attach rates, improve partner experience, and align Reveille’s offerings with Microsoft’s evolving priorities.","vocabulary_overrides":null,"epic_term_id":null,"stage_term_id":null,"activity_term_id":null,"workstream_term_id":null,"milestone_term_id":null,"tenant_id":"afac1c3e-b09d-4794-959b-1cbf509e59a5"},{"id":"09586d72-698e-4735-9bdd-232affffc883","client_id":"34e21d65-661c-4bec-bcb9-f062e50d8e9c","name":"Curriculum Associates AI Bootcamp","code":"HF-001","start_date":"2025-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","end_date":null,"commercial_scheme":"retainer","retainer_balance":null,"retainer_total":"10000.00","baseline_budget":"10000.00","sow_value":"10000.00","sow_date":"2025-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","has_sow":true,"status":"completed","created_at":"2025-09-11T23:49:53.620Z","pm":"de4f0a8f-5cac-41e0-a4ce-519400b37007","estimated_total":null,"sow_total":null,"actual_cost":null,"billed_total":null,"profit_margin":null,"description":null,"vocabulary_overrides":null,"epic_term_id":null,"stage_term_id":null,"activity_term_id":null,"workstream_term_id":null,"milestone_term_id":null,"tenant_id":"afac1c3e-b09d-4794-959b-1cbf509e59a5"},{"id":"1a8b6fc5-2ede-4775-9115-ee06391729ef","client_id":"a3cf250f-d522-4104-878a-6ab5b4115a10","name":"2026 AI Offsite","code":"CA-2601","start_date":"2026-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","end_date":"2026-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","commercial_scheme":"milestone","retainer_balance":null,"retainer_total":null,"baseline_budget":null,"sow_value":"20500.00","sow_date":"2026-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","has_sow":true,"status":"active","created_at":"2026-01-13T19:35:53.637Z","pm":"de4f0a8f-5cac-41e0-a4ce-519400b37007","estimated_total":null,"sow_total":null,"actual_cost":null,"billed_total":null,"profit_margin":null,"description":null,"vocabulary_overrides":null,"epic_term_id":null,"stage_term_id":null,"activity_term_id":null,"workstream_term_id":null,"milestone_term_id":null,"tenant_id":"afac1c3e-b09d-4794-959b-1cbf509e59a5"},{"id":"351de29d-6381-416d-a891-ba98e3be436a","client_id":"c943651e-abf4-4aaa-b689-a68d5ec1651a","name":"Strategic AI & Microsoft 365 Enablement","code":"STR-1822","start_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","end_date":null,"commercial_scheme":"fixed-price","retainer_balance":null,"retainer_total":"0.00","baseline_budget":"56800.00","sow_value":"56800.00","sow_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","has_sow":true,"status":"active","created_at":"2025-10-14T22:46:31.842Z","pm":"2041e7f2-d44c-41ba-aac2-4f516e4540cc","estimated_total":null,"sow_total":null,"actual_cost":null,"billed_total":"41800.00","profit_margin":null,"description":"This project aims to accelerate Narrative’s business growth and operational efficiency by intentionally managing technology and centralizing knowledge assets, while responsibly exploring the transformative potential of AI.

The initiative was designed to accelerate Safe-Guard’s AI readiness across executive, IT, and engineering teams, aligning with their SG 2.0 transformation goals. Through a full-day onsite session, we introduced a scalable “AI University” framework, hands-on governance and workforce readiness planning, and a GenAI evaluation scorecard to prioritize high-impact use cases. The workshop emphasized agentic AI, claims automation, and software engineering modernization—highlighting how GenAI can reduce offshore dependency while enhancing productivity and innovation.
