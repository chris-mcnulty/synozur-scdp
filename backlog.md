# Constellation Product Backlog

**Last Updated**: May 25, 2026
**Version**: 7.3 — Added Contractor Invoice Ingestion (Accounts Payable) v1 to Recently Completed: full inbound AP workflow with AI vision extraction, candidate-based reconciliation against logged time and expenses, and atomic posting of actual cost to project margin. Profit reads across the platform now prefer `actualCostAmount` (from posted vendor invoices) over rate-card estimates. v7.2 carried Status reconciliation on Teams Integration Phase 2 and Project Creation UX Enhancement.

## 🆕 Recently Completed (v2.6 — May 2026)

### Contractor Invoice Ingestion (Accounts Payable) — v1 ✅ COMPLETE

**Why.** Until now Constellation generated *outbound* contractor invoices from approved expense reports (the `contractorInvoices` PDF flow). Inbound invoices from subcontractors — covering both *services* (time billed) and *expenses* — had no home: they lived in inboxes and ad-hoc folders, and project margin numbers reflected the firm's rate-card cost estimates instead of the actual amount paid to contractors. This shipped the inbound side of AP so margin reads now reflect real cost.

**Schema (additive).** Five new tables in `shared/schema.ts`:
- [x] `vendor_invoice_uploads` — raw ingested artifacts (PDF / PNG / JPEG / HEIC) staged before LLM extraction; SHA-256 dedupe; SPE storage refs
- [x] `vendor_invoices` — canonical inbound AP invoice with full FSM (`draft → extracted → in_review → reconciled → approved → posted → paid`, plus `disputed`/`void` side states)
- [x] `vendor_invoice_lines` — per-line items kind-discriminated as `service` / `expense` / `tax` / `discount` / `other`; carries AI extraction confidence + raw JSON for audit
- [x] `vendor_invoice_line_matches` — many-to-many junction onto source `time_entries` / `expenses` with allocated amount + quantity + auto/manual provenance
- [x] `project_cost_postings` — actual-cost ledger consumed by profit reports; optionally attributed to a client `invoice_batches.batchId` for per-batch margin
- [x] Additive columns: `time_entries.vendor_invoice_line_id` + `actual_cost_amount`, same on `expenses`, `users.vendor_ingest_email`
- [x] Zod insert schemas + `vendorInvoiceExtractionSchema` defining the LLM output contract

**Backend services.**
- [x] Storage module `server/storage/vendor-invoices.ts` — CRUD plus transactional `postVendorInvoice` (writes posting rows + back-fills `vendorInvoiceLineId` + `actualCostAmount` on every matched time entry / expense) and `voidVendorInvoice` (reverses postings, clears FKs)
- [x] AI extractor `server/services/vendor-invoice-extractor.ts` — extends `ChatMessage.content` to support OpenAI-style vision content parts (text + image_url); calls the configured provider via existing `getAIProviderAsync`; validates output against the Zod schema; logs to `aiUsageLogs` under feature key `VENDOR_INVOICE_EXTRACTION`
- [x] Reconciler `server/services/vendor-invoice-reconciler.ts` — weighted candidate scoring (amount 0.5 / date 0.2 / category 0.2 / vendor 0.1); ≥0.85 auto-matches, 0.6–0.85 surfaces as a suggestion; service lines greedily fill against billed quantity; produces `matched` / `partial` / `variance` / `unmatched` per line
- [x] Routes `server/routes/vendor-invoices.ts` — every endpoint the UI calls (list, detail, multipart upload with SHA-256 dedupe + SPE storage + extraction + auto-reconcile in a single request, preview stream, per-line match candidates, accept/remove match, override, approve/post/mark-paid/void) plus `/api/my-vendor-invoices*` for vendor self-service

**UI surfaces.** All under Financial → Accounts Payable and My Workspace → Tracking:
- [x] `/vendor-invoices` — inbox with "Needs Review" tab badge, search, status filter, per-row reconcile progress, inline upload dialog
- [x] `/vendor-invoices/:id` — split-pane reviewer screen: source PDF / image on the left, header + collapsible line items with one-click match suggestions on the right; top-bar Approve → Post → Mark Paid chain follows the FSM; Void side action with required reason
- [x] `/my-vendor-invoices` — vendor self-service read-only view with vendor-friendly status labels, source-document link, line items, and timeline
- [x] Sidebar: new "Accounts Payable" subgroup under Financial; My Workspace gets "My Vendor Invoices"

**Profit impact (the payoff).** Every cost aggregation that previously read `hours * costRate` now prefers `actualCostAmount` when present:
- [x] `getProjectVarianceData` (project detail margin tile)
- [x] `getPortfolioMetrics` (financial reports portfolio table)
- [x] `getDetailedProjectAnalytics` (project drill-in)
- [x] `/reports/portfolio-analysis` billable labor cost + team cost + expense aggregation
- [x] Weekly digest `totalCost` rollup
- [x] Financial Reports "Actual Cost" tile copy notes when actuals are sourced

**Permissions.** `pm`, `billing-admin`, `admin` can review / match / override; only `billing-admin` and `admin` can approve, post, mark paid, or void. Vendors only see invoices billed to them.

### Contractor Invoice Ingestion (AP) — v1 known limitations & next iterations

- [ ] **PDF extraction.** The shared `receipt-normalizer` renders PDFs to placeholder PNGs in production (Puppeteer is disabled), so PDF invoices currently land in `draft` status with no extracted lines and need manual line entry. Fix path: enable a hosted Puppeteer service or add a parallel provider method that uses Claude's native PDF document content type.
- [ ] **Email ingest channel.** `users.vendor_ingest_email` is plumbed but no Graph shared-mailbox poller exists yet. Manual web upload is the only channel.
- [ ] **Vendor stub promotion UI.** Unknown vendors land as stub users (`canLogin = false`). No UI yet to merge a stub into a real contractor record.
- [ ] **Dispute workflow UI.** Status exists, no reviewer/vendor flow to enter dispute details and resolve.
- [ ] **GL / QuickBooks bill export.** `glBillNumber` column is plumbed; no export job.
- [ ] **Three-way match against SOW commitments.** Would tie a vendor invoice to an estimate / sub-SOW for commitment-based AP.
- [ ] **Reconciler tests.** Vitest cases against fixture rows for the scoring engine.

## 🆕 Previously In Progress — Copilot Agent Write Activities

**Status:** Phases 0–5 ✅ shipped (April 2026). Phase 6 (docs/rollout) partial — staging flag + USER_GUIDE write-up still open.
**Effort:** High (6 phases total, ~8–10 weeks to full scope)
**Design:** `/root/.claude/plans/recursive-squishing-tower.md` (planning artifact) + this backlog section

### Why
The MCP server and Copilot Studio agent are currently read-only. Users asking the agent "start an estimate for Acme Corp — block of 120 hours" get routed back to the web UI. Adding a narrow, safe write surface unlocks conversational productivity for the highest-frequency consulting workflow: estimation.

### Phase 0 — Write Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE (April 12, 2026)
- [x] `mcp_write_audit` table (tenant, user, endpoint, idempotency key, request hash, response body, resource, dry-run flag, correlation ID)
- [x] `mcpWriteGuard` middleware: `MCP_WRITES_ENABLED` feature flag, `X-Idempotency-Key` header requirement with replay-cache, request-hash conflict detection, `?dryRun=true` universal short-circuit, envelope wrapper (`idempotent`, `auditId`, `correlationId`, `dryRun`)
- [x] New `/server/routes/mcp-write.ts` module, `/mcp/v1/*` namespace registered in `server/routes.ts`
- [x] Write role constants stricter than read (admin, pm, portfolio-manager only — dropped executive and billing-admin for writes)
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/ping` diagnostic endpoint for the full write stack
- [x] OpenAPI spec updated to v1.1.0 with write paths and `X-Idempotency-Key` header
- [x] `MCP_CONNECTOR_SETUP.md` — removed READ-ONLY language; added Part 4 (write activities) covering feature flag, idempotency, dry-run, envelope, role policy, canonical agent flow

### Phase 1 — Client Discovery ✅ COMPLETE (April 12, 2026)
- [x] `GET /mcp/clients?search=&limit=` — case-insensitive substring match on name + shortName
- [x] Linkage signals in response: `hasHubspotLink` (from `crm_object_mappings`), `hasTeamsLink` (from `client_teams` or legacy `clients.microsoftTeamId`), `activeEstimateCount` (draft/sent/approved estimates)
- [x] Scoped to caller's tenant, role-gated via `ESTIMATE_ROLES`

### Phase 2 — Client Creation ✅ COMPLETE (April 12, 2026)
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/clients` with Zod validation, tenant from auth context (body `tenantId` ignored)
- [x] Near-match duplicate detection (normalize + substring + Levenshtein) against existing clients in tenant — returns 409 with candidates unless `force: true`
- [x] Shared `insertClientSchema` validation consistent with `/api/clients`

### Phase 3 — Estimate Creation (3 variants) ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort:** Medium (2–3 weeks)
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/estimates/from-narrative` — AI-generated 3–8 summary line items (hard cap)
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/estimates/block-hours` — single line item, blended rate via role catalog lookup
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/estimates/fixed-price` — `estimateType: fixed`, one line per phase
- [x] Uses existing `aiService.generateEstimateFromNarrative()` in `server/services/ai-service.ts`
- [x] Pre-create duplicate check for active estimates on the same client (409 unless `force: true`)
- [x] `createEstimateCore()` helper in `server/routes/mcp-write.ts`
- [x] Prompt-injection sanitization on the `narrative` field (`sanitizeNarrative()`)

### Phase 4 — HubSpot Linkage ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort:** Small-Medium (1–2 weeks)
- [x] `GET /mcp/v1/hubspot/search?type=company|deal&query=`
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/clients/:clientId/hubspot-link` with `createIfMissing` flag — writes `crm_object_mappings`, uses `createHubSpotDeal()` / `createHubSpotCompany()` from `hubspot-client.ts`

### Phase 5 — Teams Team + Channel Linkage ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort:** Medium (2 weeks)
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/clients/:clientId/teams-link` — ensures `client_teams` row (creates team via Graph when `createIfMissing`)
- [x] `POST /mcp/v1/projects/:projectId/teams-channel` — ensures `project_channels` row via `plannerService.createChannel()`
- [x] Partial-failure envelope: `warnings[]` preserved; no rollback of prior successful steps

### Phase 6 — Docs, Agent Instructions, Rollout
- [x] OpenAPI spec updated for each phase (bumped to v1.2.0 for Phase 3-5)
- [x] Connector setup doc updated with write-flow agent instructions (Phase 0)
- [ ] `USER_GUIDE.md` — new "Conversational Estimate Creation" section (gated on Phase 3)
- [ ] Enable `MCP_WRITES_ENABLED=true` in staging for pilot tenant(s) after Phase 3

### Explicit Non-Goals for v1
Estimate approval/status transitions, invoice generation, line-item-level edits (would defeat the agent metaphor), project creation (use existing approve-estimate flow), user/role management, expense submission.

- [ ] Persist view preferences per user

### Orphaned Invoice PDF File Cleanup (Task #22)
**Status:** Planned
**Effort:** Low (2-3 days)

Invoice PDF files stored in SharePoint/object storage are never removed when a batch is deleted, and the regeneration path silently swallows delete errors — leaving orphaned and duplicate files accumulating in storage indefinitely.

- [ ] Delete stored PDF automatically when a batch is deleted (hook into `deleteInvoiceBatch()`)
- [ ] Admin endpoint `POST /api/admin/purge-orphan-invoice-pdfs` with `?dryRun=true` support — lists all stored files, cross-references against live `pdfFileId` values, deletes unmatched, returns summary
- [ ] Harden the "delete old version before regenerate" step: replace silent catch with a logged warning (batchId + file ID) so storage failures are visible in production logs
- [ ] Run purge against production after deploy to clear pre-existing orphans

### SPE File Lifecycle & Orphan Cleanup
**Status:** Design Required
**Effort:** Medium (3-5 weeks)

- [ ] Design cleanup strategy for SharePoint Embedded files tied to draft or deleted invoices, deleted expenses, and other transient artifacts
- [ ] Identify and catalog all SPE file creation points (invoice PDFs, expense receipts, SOW documents, deliverable attachments, etc.)
- [ ] Define retention policies: which files should be soft-deleted, hard-deleted, or archived when their parent record is removed
- [ ] Build orphan detection service: find SPE files with no matching database record (e.g., invoice PDF exists but batch was deleted, receipt uploaded but expense was removed)
- [ ] Implement periodic cleanup job (scheduled task) to flag or remove orphaned files based on retention rules
- [ ] Consider discoverability impact: ensure deleted/draft artifacts are excluded from MCP and Copilot queries so AI assistants don't surface stale data
- [ ] Add admin UI for reviewing orphaned files before permanent deletion (safety net)
- [ ] Handle edge cases: files referenced by multiple records, files in tenant-specific vs shared containers, migration-era files with null tenantId
