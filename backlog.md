## ðŸ“Š P2 - IMPORTANT FEATURES (Weeks 5-8)

### QuickBooks Online Integration
**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING - Downgraded from P0

- [ ] Retry mechanism and validation error handling
- [ ] Webhook integration for bi-directional sync status
- [ ] QBO sync status dashboard

### Mobile Web Interface Optimization

**Scope:**
- [ ] Touch-first time entry with large touch targets
- [ ] Quick time tracking with start/stop buttons
- [ ] Timer-based time tracking for real-time capture
- [ ] Mobile expense capture with camera integration

- [ ] Version history viewer
- [ ] Document approval workflow UI

### Project Status Report Generation - NEW
**Status:** PLANNING - Essential for project visibility and communication

**Why P2:** Important for stakeholder communication and project tracking, but core operations can function without it initially.

**Scope:**
- [ ] **Comprehensive Status Reports**
  - Project overview with vision/description
  - Milestone progress (target vs actual dates)
  - Assignment completion rates by person/role
  - Budget vs actual (time and expenses)
  - Variance analysis and trending
  
- [ ] **Date Range Filtering**
  - Generate reports for specific periods
  - Weekly, monthly, quarterly options
  - Custom date ranges
  - Point-in-time snapshots

  - Team member
  - Service line
- [ ] Trend analysis over time
- [ ] Accuracy improvement tracking
- [ ] Lessons learned repository
- [ ] Predictive accuracy modeling

### Excel Import/Export Redevelopment
**Status:** HIDDEN FROM UI - Security review required
**Date Hidden:** October 8, 2025

**Why Hidden:** Excel export/import previously exposed cost-sensitive fields (cost rates, margins, profit) that should not be shared externally. Feature hidden pending redevelopment with proper field filtering.

**Decision Options:**
1. **Redevelop with Security Controls**
   - Implement role-based field filtering for Excel exports
   - Remove cost-sensitive columns for non-admin/non-executive users
   - Add clear warnings about data sensitivity
   - Match CSV export security model (cost fields completely hidden)
   
2. **Deprecate Feature**
   - Remove Excel functionality entirely
   - Standardize on CSV for bulk operations (simpler, more secure)
   - Clean up Excel-related code and dependencies
   - Update documentation to reflect CSV-only approach

**Current Status:**
- Excel buttons commented out in estimate detail UI
- Excel backend endpoints still exist but inaccessible from UI
- CSV import/export fully functional with cost-sensitive fields removed
- Users can use CSV for bulk operations without exposing sensitive data

**Recommendation:** Evaluate usage patterns and user feedback before deciding. If Excel offers no significant advantages over CSV, deprecation may be simpler and more maintainable.

  - Clear visual indicator of which factor source is active
  
- [ ] **Factor Management Interface**
