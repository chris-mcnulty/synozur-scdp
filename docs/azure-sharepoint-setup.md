## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Azure Subscription** with admin access to create app registrations
- **Microsoft 365 tenant** with SharePoint Embedded capabilities
- **SharePoint Admin privileges** to create and manage containers
- **Global Administrator** or **Application Administrator** role in Azure AD
- Access to the SCDP application environment variables

### Required Permissions Levels

| Component | Required Role | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Azure AD | Application Administrator | Create app registrations, manage permissions |
| SharePoint Embedded | SharePoint Administrator | Create and manage containers |
| Application | System Administrator | Configure environment variables |

## Azure AD App Registration

### Step 1: Create the App Registration

1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
   - Search for "App registrations" or navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations

2. **Create New Registration**
   - Click "New registration"
   - Fill in the details:
     ```
     Name: SCDP Expense Attachments
     Supported account types: Accounts in this organizational directory only
     Redirect URI: Web - [Leave blank for now]
     ```
   - Click "Register"

3. **Note Important Values**
   After registration, record these values (you'll need them later):
   ```
   Application (client) ID: [Copy this value]
   Directory (tenant) ID: [Copy this value]
   Object ID: [Copy this value]
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Authentication

1. **Set Redirect URIs**
   - Go to "Authentication" in the left menu
   - Click "Add a platform" > "Web"
   - Add redirect URIs based on your environment:
     ```
     Development: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
     Replit: https://[repl-name].[username].repl.co/api/auth/callback
     Production: https://scdp.synozur.com/api/auth/callback
     ```

2. **Configure Logout URL**
   - In the same Authentication section, add:
     ```
     Front-channel logout URL: [Your base URL]
     ```

### Step 3: Create Client Secret

1. **Generate Secret**
   - Go to "Certificates & secrets" > "Client secrets"
   - Click "New client secret"
   - Add description: "SCDP Production Secret"
   - Set expiration: "24 months" (recommended for production)
   - Click "Add"

2. **Record Secret Value**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Copy the secret VALUE immediately!
   This is your only chance to see the full secret.
   
   Client Secret: [Copy this value - it's long]
   Secret ID: [For reference only]
   Expires: [Note the expiration date]
   ```

### Step 4: Configure API Permissions

The application requires specific Microsoft Graph permissions for SharePoint file operations:

1. **Navigate to API Permissions**
   - Go to "API permissions" in the left menu
   - Click "Add a permission"

2. **Add Microsoft Graph Permissions**
   **RECOMMENDED (SharePoint Embedded)**: Add **FileStorageContainer.Selected** permission:
   
   | Permission | Type | Purpose | Scope |
   |------------|------|---------|-------|
   | `FileStorageContainer.Selected` | Application | Access specific SharePoint Embedded containers only | Container-specific |

   **Steps to add FileStorageContainer.Selected:**
   - Click "Add a permission" > "Microsoft Graph" > "Application permissions"
   - Search for "FileStorageContainer.Selected"
   - Check the permission box
   - Click "Add permissions"

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **LEGACY PERMISSIONS**: SharePoint Online Permissions (NOT FOR EMBEDDED)
   
   **DO NOT USE** these SharePoint Online permissions for SharePoint Embedded containers:
   
   | Permission | Type | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue |
   |------------|------|---------|
   | `Sites.ReadWrite.All` | Application | **Legacy** - For SharePoint Online sites only |
   | `Files.ReadWrite.All` | Application | **Legacy** - For SharePoint Online files only |
   | `Sites.Selected` | Application | **Legacy** - For SharePoint Online site-specific access |
   
   **For SharePoint Embedded containers, use only:**
   - `FileStorageContainer.Selected` - Container-specific access
   
   **SharePoint Embedded provides isolated containers with built-in security boundaries.**

3. **Grant Admin Consent**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED: Admin consent must be granted for application permissions
   ```
   - Click "Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]"
   - Confirm by clicking "Yes"
   - Verify all permissions show "Granted for [Your Organization]"

### Step 5: Configure Application Settings

1. **Set Application Type**
   - Go to "Manifest" in the left menu
   - Ensure these settings:
     ```json
     "allowPublicClient": false,
     "signInAudience": "AzureADMyOrg"
     ```

2. **Optional: Add App Roles** (for future granular permissions)
   - Go to "App roles" 
   - You can define custom roles like "ExpenseManager", "FileUploader" etc.

## SharePoint Embedded Container Setup

### Step 1: Create SharePoint Embedded Container

SharePoint Embedded containers provide isolated storage environments with built-in security and access control.

1. **Create Container via Graph API**
   ```bash
   # Get access token with FileStorageContainer.Selected permission
   curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client-id}&client_secret={client-secret}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"
   
   # Create new container
   curl -X POST "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "displayName": "SCDP Expense Attachments",
       "description": "Container for SCDP expense receipt storage",
       "containerTypeId": "{container-type-id}"
     }'
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use Existing Container**
   - Identify an existing SharePoint Embedded container
   - Ensure your application has access to the container
   - Note the container ID for configuration

### Step 2: Verify Container Access

Confirm your application can access the SharePoint Embedded container:

```bash
# List accessible containers
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"

# Get specific container details
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"

# Test container drive access
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}/drive/root/children" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"
```

### Step 3: Set Up Folder Structure

The system automatically creates folders in the **container** using this structure:
```
/Container Root/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Receipts/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT1/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EXP001/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ receipt1.pdf
      ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ receipt2.jpg
      ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EXP002/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT2/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2026/
```

**Initial Setup:**
1. ‚úÖ Use the SharePoint Embedded container (isolated storage)
2. ü§ñ The application will automatically create the "/Receipts" folder and year/project/expense subfolders as needed
3. üîí Built-in security boundaries and access control

### Step 4: Container Access and Permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: SharePoint Embedded containers use FileStorageContainer.Selected permission with automatic container access.

**SharePoint Embedded Container Access**

SharePoint Embedded containers automatically grant access when using FileStorageContainer.Selected permission:

```bash
# Container access is automatically granted when:
# 1. Application has FileStorageContainer.Selected permission with admin consent
# 2. Application creates or is assigned to specific containers
# 3. No manual site permission assignment needed

# To list accessible containers:
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {app-access-token}"

# To get specific container details:
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {app-access-token}"

# To access container drive:
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}/drive/root/children" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {app-access-token}"
```

**Replace the placeholders:**
- `{app-access-token}`: Access token with FileStorageContainer.Selected
- `{container-id}`: Your SharePoint Embedded container ID

**Get app access token for testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={your-app-id}&client_secret={your-app-secret}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"
```

### Step 5: Get SharePoint Embedded Container ID

You'll need the container ID for environment configuration:

1. **Get Container ID via Graph API**
   ```bash
   # Using Microsoft Graph Explorer (recommended)
   # Go to: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer
   # Query: GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers
   # Find your container in the response and note the 'id' field
   ```

2. **Get Container ID via cURL**
   ```bash
   # List all accessible containers
   curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"
   
   # Find your container by displayName and note the 'id' field
   ```

3. **Container Information**
   - Container ID: Use this as SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER_ID
   - Container Type ID: Optional, use as CONTAINER_TYPE_ID if needed
   - Display Name: For reference and identification

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Configure these environment variables in your application:

```bash
# Azure AD Configuration
AZURE_CLIENT_ID="[Application ID from Step 1]"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="[Directory ID from Step 1]"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="[Client Secret from Step 3]"

# Optional: Custom redirect URIs (if different from auto-detected)
AZURE_REDIRECT_URI="https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback"
POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI="https://yourdomain.com"

# SharePoint Embedded Configuration
SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER_ID="[Container ID from Step 5]"

# Optional: Container Type ID for reference
CONTAINER_TYPE_ID="[Container Type ID if needed]"
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

#### Development Environment

```bash
# Local development
AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-dev-app-id"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-dev-secret"
SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER_ID="your-container-id"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

#### Replit Environment

```bash
# Replit deployment
AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-replit-app-id"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-replit-secret"
SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER_ID="your-container-id"
REPL_SLUG="your-repl-name"
REPL_OWNER="your-username"
```

#### Production Environment

```bash
# Production deployment
AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-prod-app-id"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-prod-secret"
SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER_ID="your-container-id"
NODE_ENV="production"
REPLIT_DOMAINS="1" # if using Replit for production
```

### How to Find SharePoint Embedded Container ID

#### Method 1: Microsoft Graph Explorer (Easiest)

1. Go to [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer)
2. Sign in with your admin account
3. **List Accessible Containers:**
   ```
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers
   ```
   Look for your container in the response and note the `id` field

4. **Get Specific Container Details:**
   ```
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}
   ```
   Verify container details and access

#### Method 2: cURL Commands

```bash
# Get access token first
curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client-id}&client_secret={client-secret}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"

# List containers
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"
```

#### Method 3: PowerShell with Graph API

```powershell
# Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Force

# Connect with appropriate scopes
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "FileStorageContainer.Selected"

# List containers
Get-MgStorageFileStorageContainer
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

**RECOMMENDED: SharePoint Embedded Container Permissions**
- ‚úÖ Use `FileStorageContainer.Selected` application permission
- ‚úÖ Automatic access to assigned containers only
- ‚úÖ Built-in isolation and security boundaries
- ‚úÖ No tenant-wide permissions needed

**‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID: Legacy SharePoint Online Permissions**
- ‚ùå `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (for SharePoint Online sites)
- ‚ùå `Files.ReadWrite.All` (for SharePoint Online files)
- ‚ùå `Sites.Selected` (for SharePoint Online site-specific)
- ‚ùå `Sites.FullControl.All` (for SharePoint Online administration)

**Modern SharePoint App Security Model:**
- Use Graph API permissions instead of classic SharePoint permissions
- Assign app to specific sites via SharePoint Admin Center
- No AppInv.aspx or XML permission requests required
- Site assignments can be managed without app registration changes

### 2. Modern Authentication & Secret Management

**Client Credentials Flow (Recommended for Backend Apps):**
- ‚úÖ Use confidential client application type
- ‚úÖ Client credentials grant for app-only operations
- ‚úÖ No user interaction required for file operations
- ‚ùå Do NOT use implicit grant flow (legacy)
- ‚ùå Do NOT enable public client flows

**Client Secret Security:**
```bash
# DO NOT commit secrets to version control
# Use environment variables or secure vaults

# Secret rotation schedule (recommended)
Production: Rotate every 12 months
Development: Rotate every 24 months  
Test/Staging: Rotate every 18 months
```

**Secret Storage Options (Preferred Order):**
1. **Azure Key Vault** (production environments)
2. **Replit Secrets** (Replit deployments)
3. **CI/CD secret stores** (GitHub Secrets, Azure DevOps)
4. **Environment variables** (local development only)

### 3. Network Security

**Allowed Redirect URIs:**
- Only add necessary redirect URIs
- Use HTTPS for all production URLs
- Avoid wildcard domains

**CORS Configuration:**
- Configure CORS policies to restrict domains
- Don't use `*` for allowed origins in production

### 4. Monitoring and Auditing

**Enable Audit Logging:**
```bash
# Azure AD Sign-in logs
# SharePoint audit logs
# Application insights for the SCDP app
```

**Monitor for:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file access patterns
- Large file uploads outside business hours
- Geographic anomalies in access

### 5. Production vs Development Configurations

#### Development Environment
- Use separate Azure AD app registration
- Point to test SharePoint site
- Enable verbose logging
- Allow HTTP for localhost

#### Production Environment
- Dedicated app registration with production secrets
- Production SharePoint site with backups
- Minimal logging (no PII)
- HTTPS only
- IP restrictions (if applicable)

**Configuration Separation:**
```bash
# Use different environment files
.env.development
.env.production
.env.test

# Never mix development and production credentials
```

```bash
# 1. Test authentication and get access token
curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client-id}&client_secret={client-secret}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"

# 2. Test container access
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"

# 3. Test container drive access
curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/storage/fileStorage/containers/{container-id}/drive/root/children" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access-token}"
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "AADSTS50011: The reply URL specified in the request does not match"
**Solution:**
- Verify redirect URI in Azure AD matches your application URL exactly
- Check for trailing slashes, HTTP vs HTTPS
- Update redirect URI in Azure AD app registration

#### Issue: "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation"
**Solution:**
- Verify admin consent was granted for all permissions
- Check that permissions are "Application" type, not "Delegated"
- Ensure FileStorageContainer.Selected permission was configured correctly

#### Issue: "MSAL instance not configured"
**Solution:**
- Verify all four required environment variables are set:
  - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
  - AZURE_TENANT_ID
  - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
  - SHAREPOINT_CONTAINER_ID  
  - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
- Check environment variable values don't contain extra spaces or quotes

#### Issue: "Site or drive not found"
**Solution:**
- Verify Site ID and Drive ID are correct
- Use Microsoft Graph Explorer to validate IDs
- Check that the app has permissions to the specific site

#### Issue: "Invalid client secret"
**Solution:**
- Generate a new client secret (old one may have expired)
- Verify the full secret value was copied correctly
- Check secret hasn't exceeded expiration date

## Integration with Existing MSAL Setup

The SCDP application already has MSAL integration configured. Here's how the expense attachment system integrates:

### Current MSAL Configuration

The application uses two authentication flows:

1. **User Authentication** (existing):
   - Used for user login and profile access
   - Scopes: `user.read`, `profile`, `email`, `openid`
   - Flow: Authorization Code Flow

2. **App-Only Authentication** (for file operations):
   - Used for SharePoint file operations
   - Scopes: `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`
   - Flow: Client Credentials Flow

### Environment Variable Precedence

The system detects configuration in this order:

```javascript
// 1. Explicit redirect URI (highest priority)
process.env.AZURE_REDIRECT_URI

// 2. Replit automatic detection
`https://${process.env.REPL_SLUG}.${process.env.REPL_OWNER}.repl.co`

// 3. Production domain
"https://scdp.synozur.com"

// 4. Local development (lowest priority)
"http://localhost:5000"
```

### Authentication Flow Integration

#### User Login Flow (Existing)
```
User -> Azure AD Login -> Callback -> User Session
```

#### File Upload Flow (New)
```
File Upload Request -> App-Only Token -> SharePoint API -> Success
```

### Code Integration Points

The expense attachment system integrates at these points:

1. **Environment Configuration** (`server/auth/entra-config.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Already configured - no changes needed
   export const msalInstance = isConfigured 
     ? new ConfidentialClientApplication(msalConfig)
     : null;
   ```

2. **Graph Client Service** (`server/services/graph-client.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Handles SharePoint operations with app-only authentication
   export const graphClient = new GraphClient();
   ```

3. **API Routes** (to be added):
   ```typescript
   // Expense attachment endpoints
   app.post('/api/expenses/:id/attachments', uploadAttachment);
   app.get('/api/expenses/:id/attachments', listAttachments);
   app.delete('/api/attachments/:id', deleteAttachment);
   ```

### Health Check Endpoints

The system provides health check endpoints for configuration validation:

```bash
# Check Azure AD configuration
GET /api/health/azure-config

# Check SharePoint connectivity  
GET /api/health/sharepoint

# Test file operations
POST /api/test/upload
```

### Troubleshooting Integration Issues

#### Authentication Conflicts
- The app-only flow is independent of user authentication
- Both can run simultaneously without conflicts
- File operations don't require user to be logged in

#### Token Management
- User tokens and app-only tokens are managed separately
- App-only tokens are cached for 5 minutes with automatic refresh
- No user token interaction required for file operations

#### Permission Overlap
- User permissions (delegated) and app permissions (application) are different
- App permissions allow file operations without user context
- No permission elevation concerns

### Development vs Production Behavior

#### Development Mode
- Detailed logging enabled for both authentication flows
- HTTP allowed for localhost redirect URIs
- Verbose error messages for debugging

#### Production Mode
- Minimal logging (no PII)
- HTTPS required for all operations
- Simplified error messages for security

## Testing & Troubleshooting

### Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Environment Configuration Test
```bash
# Test 1: Verify environment variables
node -e "
console.log('AZURE_CLIENT_ID:', process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
console.log('AZURE_TENANT_ID:', process.env.AZURE_TENANT_ID ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
console.log('AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET:', process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
console.log('SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID:', process.env.SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
console.log('SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_ID:', process.env.SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_ID ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
"
```

#### 2. Application Health Check
```bash
# Test 2: Start the application and check health endpoints
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the health endpoints:
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/health/azure-config"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/health/sharepoint"
```

#### 3. Microsoft Graph API Test
```bash
# Test 3: Test Graph API connectivity
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/health/graph-test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### 4. SharePoint Access Test
```javascript
// Test 4: Direct SharePoint API test
const { graphClient } = require('./server/services/graph-client.js');

async function testSharePoint() {
  try {
    const result = await graphClient.testConnectivity(
      process.env.SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID,
      process.env.SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_ID
    );
    console.log('SharePoint Test Result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('SharePoint Test Failed:', error.message);
  }
}

testSharePoint();
```

### Automated Testing

Create test scripts for continuous validation:

#### Comprehensive Test Script: `test-azure-setup.js`

**Prerequisites:**
1. ‚úÖ Complete Azure AD and SharePoint setup (following this guide)
2. ‚úÖ Set all required environment variables  
3. ‚úÖ **Start the application first**: `npm run dev`

**Run the test:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Start the application in one terminal
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the comprehensive test
node test-azure-setup.js

# Optional: Test against different environment
TEST_BASE_URL=https://your-app.replit.app node test-azure-setup.js
```

**The test validates:**
- üîß Environment variables configuration
- üîê Azure AD MSAL setup via health endpoint  
- üåê Microsoft Graph authentication

### Common Error Scenarios

#### Error: "Application is not assigned to any users or groups"
**Cause:** App registration requires user assignment
**Solution:**
1. Go to Azure AD > Enterprise Applications
2. Find your app registration
3. Go to "Users and groups"
4. Assign appropriate users or groups

#### Error: "The client does not exist or is not enabled for consumers"
**Cause:** Incorrect tenant ID or client ID
**Solution:**
1. Verify AZURE_TENANT_ID matches your Azure AD tenant
2. Verify AZURE_CLIENT_ID matches your app registration
3. Check for extra spaces or characters in environment variables

#### Error: "Access denied" when uploading files
**Cause:** Insufficient SharePoint permissions
**Solution:**
1. Verify SharePoint app permissions were granted correctly
2. Check that admin consent was completed
3. Ensure the app has Write permissions to the specific site

#### Error: "Drive not found"
**Cause:** Incorrect Drive ID or permissions
**Solution:**
1. Re-verify Drive ID using Graph Explorer
2. Check that the document library exists
3. Ensure app has permissions to the site containing the drive

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics for optimal performance:

```bash
# Token acquisition time (should be < 2 seconds)
# File upload time (varies by file size)
# SharePoint API response time (should be < 5 seconds)
# Error rates (should be < 1%)
```

### Logging Configuration

Enable appropriate logging levels:

```javascript
// Development
process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'debug';

// Production  
process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'info';

// Error tracking
process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'error';
```
