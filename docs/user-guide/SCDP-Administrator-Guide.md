**Information Needed:**
- Full legal name
- Email address (for SSO)
- Job title
- Department/team
- Role (employee, PM, billing-admin, executive, admin)
- Default billing rate
- Default cost rate
- Start date

**Step-by-Step:**

![Create User](screenshots/admin-02-user-create.png)

1. Navigate to **Users** → **Add User**
2. Enter user details:
   ```
   Email: john.smith@company.com
   First Name: John
   Last Name: Smith
   Full Name: John Smith
   Initials: JS
   Title: Senior Consultant
   Role: employee
   Can Login: ✅ (enabled)
   Is Assignable: ✅ (enabled)
   Is Active: ✅ (enabled)
   Default Billing Rate: $175.00
   Default Cost Rate: $100.00
   ```
3. Click **"Create User"**
4. System sends welcome email (if configured)
5. User can now log in via SSO

**Important Flags:**

**Can Login:**
- ✅ ON: User can authenticate and access SCDP
- ❌ OFF: User exists for tracking only (contractors, historical)

**Is Assignable:**
- ✅ ON: Appears in resource allocation dropdowns
- ❌ OFF: Hidden from project assignments (non-delivery staff)

**Is Active:**
- ✅ ON: Normal active user
- ❌ OFF: Deactivated (preserves historical data)

---

#### Editing Existing Users

**Common Edit Scenarios:**

**Promotion/Role Change:**
```
Scenario: John Smith promoted to Project Manager
Action:
1. Edit user: John Smith
2. Change Role: employee → pm
3. Update Title: Senior Consultant → Project Manager
4. Adjust rates if applicable
5. Save changes
Result: John immediately has PM permissions
```

**Rate Adjustment:**
```
Scenario: Annual rate increase
Action:
1. Edit user
2. Update Default Billing Rate: $175 → $185
3. Update Default Cost Rate: $100 → $105
4. Document reason: "2025 Annual Increase"
5. Save
Result: New estimates use new rate; existing unchanged
```

**Leave of Absence:**
```
Scenario: Employee on extended leave
Action:
1. Edit user
2. Set Is Assignable: ❌ (prevents new assignments)
3. Keep Can Login: ✅ (can access for expenses if needed)
4. Keep Is Active: ✅ (still employed)
5. Add note: "LOA until MM/DD/YYYY"
Result: Hidden from new allocations but can access system
```

---

#### Offboarding Users

**CRITICAL: Never delete users with historical data!**

![User Offboarding](screenshots/admin-02-user-offboard.png)

**Proper Offboarding Process:**

```
Step 1: Disable Access (Last Day)
1. Edit user
2. Set Can Login: ❌
3. Set Is Assignable: ❌
4. Keep Is Active: ✅ (for now)
5. Add termination date in notes

Step 2: Reassign Active Work (Within 1 week)
1. Review user's active project assignments
2. Reassign to other team members
3. Update resource allocations
4. Notify affected project managers

Step 3: Archive (After 30 days)
1. Export user's time/expense history
2. Set Is Active: ❌
3. User hidden from default views
4. All historical data preserved
5. Can still see in reports/audit logs

Step 4: Document (Ongoing)
- Keep records of:
  - Final timesheet
  - Outstanding expenses
  - Project knowledge transfer
  - Exit interview notes
```

**Why Not Delete:**
- Breaks time entry references
- Corrupts expense report data
- Loses project allocation history
- Breaks audit trail
- Cannot recreate historical reports

**Deactivate Instead:**
- Preserves all historical data
- Maintains referential integrity
- Supports audit requirements
- Allows historical reporting
- Can reactivate if rehired

---

#### Annual Rate Updates

**Bulk Rate Increase:**

![Bulk Rate Update](screenshots/admin-02-bulk-rates.png)

```
Scenario: 5% annual increase for all employees
Process:
1. Export current user list with rates
2. Calculate new rates in Excel
3. Prepare import CSV with updated rates
4. Import to update rates
5. Document change: "2025 Annual 5% Increase"
6. Notify PMs of new rates
```

**Selective Updates:**

```
Scenario: Different increases by role
Process:
1. Filter users by role
2. Update each role group:

```

---

## 4. Rate & Billing Configuration

### 4.1 Rate Hierarchy Architecture

![Rate Hierarchy](screenshots/admin-03-rate-hierarchy.png)

**Three-Tier System:**

```
Tier 1: System Defaults (Fallback)
   ↓ (can override)
Tier 2: Client-Specific Rates
   ↓ (can override)
Tier 3: Project-Specific Rates (Highest Priority)
```

**Resolution Logic:**

```javascript
function getBillingRate(user, project) {
  // Check project-specific override
  if (project.hasRateOverride(user)) {
    return project.getRateOverride(user);
  }
  
  // Check client-specific override
  if (project.client.hasRateOverride(user.role)) {
    return project.client.getRateOverride(user.role);
  }
  
  // Fall back to user default
  return user.defaultBillingRate;
}
```

---

### 4.2 Managing Role-Based Rates

**Standard Roles Setup:**

![Role Rates](screenshots/admin-03-roles.png)

**Creating a Role:**

```
Example: Senior Consultant
1. Navigate to Rates → Roles
2. Click "Add Role"
3. Enter:
   Name: Senior Consultant
   Default Rack Rate: $175.00
4. Save

Result: Available in estimates and user profiles
```

**Typical Role Structure:**

```
Executive Tier:
├─ Partner: $300/hr
├─ Managing Director: $275/hr
└─ Director: $250/hr

Senior Tier:
├─ Principal Consultant: $225/hr
├─ Senior Consultant: $175/hr
└─ Senior Analyst: $150/hr

Mid Tier:
├─ Consultant: $135/hr
├─ Analyst: $110/hr
└─ Associate: $95/hr

Project Management:
├─ Senior PM: $200/hr
├─ Project Manager: $160/hr
└─ Project Coordinator: $120/hr

Specialized:
├─ Architect: $225/hr
├─ Technical Lead: $200/hr
└─ Designer: $150/hr
```

**Annual Rate Review Process:**

```
Q4 Annual Review:
1. Export current rates
2. Compare to market data (salary surveys)
3. Calculate desired increases
4. Review profitability by role
5. Get executive approval
6. Update rates in SCDP
7. Communicate to organization
8. Effective date: Jan 1

Timeline:
├─ October: Gather market data
├─ November: Analyze and propose
├─ Early December: Get approvals
└─ Late December: Implement in system
```

---

### 4.3 Client-Specific Rate Overrides

**When to Use:**

✅ **Volume Discounts**
```
Example: Client commits to $500K annual spend
Action: Set 10% discount on all rates
Implementation:
1. Open client: Acme Corp
2. Navigate to Rate Overrides
3. For each role used:
   - Senior Consultant: $175 → $157.50
   - Consultant: $135 → $121.50
4. Document: "Volume discount - $500K commitment"
5. Set expiration: Dec 31, 2025
```

✅ **Contractual Agreements**
```
Example: MSA specifies fixed rates
Action: Set exact contract rates
Implementation:
1. Review signed contract rate schedule
2. Create override for each role
3. Link to contract document
4. All projects use these rates
```

✅ **Strategic Pricing**
```
Example: New client, competitive bid
Action: Reduce rates 5-10% to win work
Implementation:
1. Calculate reduced rates
2. Set client overrides
3. Document: "Strategic pricing - new client acquisition"
4. Review after first project
```

❌ **Don't Use For:**
- One-off projects (use project override instead)
- Temporary adjustments
- Pilot/proof-of-concept work

---

### 4.4 Project-Specific Rate Overrides

**When to Use:**

✅ **Non-Profit/Pro-Bono**
```
Example: Charity work at reduced rates
Action: Set special rates for this project only
Rates: 50% of standard or $0 for pro-bono
```

✅ **Blended Rate Contracts**
```
Example: Contract specifies single blended rate
Action: Set all team members to $150/hr
Benefit: Simplifies invoicing
```

✅ **Fixed-Price True-Up**
```
Example: Fixed price project, need to track actuals
Action: Set internal rates for margin tracking
Purpose: Compare actual cost vs fixed price
```

✅ **Pilot/POC Pricing**
```
Example: Proof-of-concept with special pricing
Action: Reduce rates 20% for pilot only
Duration: Single project
```

❌ **Don't Overuse:**
- Creates configuration complexity
- Hard to maintain
- Difficult to audit
- Use client-level when possible

---

### 4.5 Rate Snapshot Mechanism

**How It Works:**

![Rate Snapshot](screenshots/admin-03-snapshot.png)

```
When Estimate Created (Feb 1, 2025):
├─ Current Rates Captured:
│   ├─ Senior Consultant: $175/hr
│   ├─ Consultant: $135/hr
│   └─ Analyst: $110/hr
├─ Saved in estimate.rackRateSnapshot JSON field
└─ These rates used for ALL line items

Rate Change (May 1, 2025):
├─ Update rates in system:
│   ├─ Senior Consultant: $175 → $185/hr
│   ├─ Consultant: $135 → $145/hr
│   └─ Analyst: $110 → $120/hr
└─ Existing estimate UNAFFECTED (still uses $175, $135, $110)

New Estimate (May 2, 2025):
├─ Uses NEW rates:
│   ├─ Senior Consultant: $185/hr
│   ├─ Consultant: $145/hr
│   └─ Analyst: $120/hr
└─ Snapshot saved again
```

**Benefits:**
- Estimates remain accurate over time
- No retroactive pricing changes
- Clear audit trail
- Can compare historical estimates
- Supports long sales cycles

**Viewing Historical Rates:**

```
In Estimate Detail:
1. Open any estimate
2. Click "Rate Snapshot" tab
3. View rates as of estimate creation date
4. Compare to current rates
5. See what changed since creation
```

## 5. SharePoint Integration

### 5.1 Architecture Overview

![SharePoint Architecture](screenshots/admin-04-sharepoint-architecture.png)

**SCDP uses SharePoint Online for document storage:**

```
Storage Strategy:
├─ SharePoint Online (Primary)
│   ├─ Receipts: Expense receipt images
│   ├─ Invoices: Generated invoice PDFs
│   ├─ SOWs: Statements of Work
│   └─ Change Orders: Contract amendments
├─ Replit Object Storage (Legacy, being phased out)
└─ Local Filesystem (Development only)
```

**Authentication:**
- Replit SharePoint Connector
- OAuth 2.0 via Microsoft Graph API
- Automatic token refresh
- No certificate management required

**Organization:**
- Environment-specific (dev vs prod)

### 5.3 Folder Structure

**Auto-Created Folders:**

![Folder Structure](screenshots/admin-04-folders.png)

```
SharePoint Library Root (SCDP-Dev or SCDP-Prod)
├── receipts/
│   ├── receipt-20250101-001.jpg
│   ├── receipt-20250102-005.png
│   └── receipt-20250115-023.pdf
├── invoices/
│   ├── INV-001-ClientA-ProjectX.pdf
│   ├── INV-002-ClientB-ProjectY.pdf
│   └── batch-2025-01-invoice.pdf
├── sows/
│   ├── ClientA-MSA-2025.pdf
│   ├── ClientB-SOW-ProjectY.pdf
│   └── ClientC-ChangeOrder-001.pdf
└── changeorders/
    ├── ClientA-CO-001.pdf
    ├── ClientA-CO-002.pdf
    └── ClientB-CO-001.pdf
```

**Folder Creation:**
- Automatic on first file upload
- Idempotent (won't duplicate)
- Uses 404 check before creation
- No "rename" conflicts under concurrency

**Benefits:**
- Organized by document type
- Easy to find documents
- Supports bulk operations
- Clear audit trail

---

### 5.4 URL Handling

**Supported SharePoint Site URL Formats:**

![URL Formats](screenshots/admin-04-url-formats.png)

```
Format 1: Root Site Collection
URL: https://company.sharepoint.com/
Graph API Path: /sites/company.sharepoint.com

Format 2: Single-Level Site
URL: https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/RevOps/
Graph API Path: /sites/company.sharepoint.com:/sites/RevOps

Format 3: Multi-Level Site
URL: https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/RevOps/Finance/
Graph API Path: /sites/company.sharepoint.com:/sites/RevOps/Finance
```

**System automatically:**
- Parses URL using URL class
- Extracts hostname and path
- Builds correct Graph API endpoint
- Handles trailing slashes
- Validates format

**Common Mistakes:**

```
❌ Wrong:
- http://company.sharepoint.com/ (not HTTPS)
- company.sharepoint.com (missing protocol)
- /sites/RevOps (missing domain)
- https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/RevOps (missing trailing slash)

✅ Correct:
- https://company.sharepoint.com/
- https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/RevOps/
- https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/RevOps/Finance/
```

### 5.5 Performance Optimization

**Drive ID Caching:**

![Drive Cache](screenshots/admin-04-cache.png)

```
Without Caching (Slow):
Every file operation:
1. GET /sites/{site}/drives → Get all drives
2. Filter drives by library name
3. Use drive ID for file operation
4. Repeat for EVERY file (n × API calls)

With Caching (Fast):
First operation:
1. GET /sites/{site}/drives → Get all drives
2. Filter drives by library name
3. Cache drive ID in memory
4. Use drive ID

Subsequent operations:
1. Use cached drive ID (no API call)
2. Direct file operation
3. Result: 1 API call vs n API calls
```

**Cache Invalidation:**

```
Cache Key: "siteUrl:libraryName"
Example: "https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/RevOps/:SCDP-Prod"

Cache cleared when:
- Application restarts
- Configuration changes
- Manual cache clear (if needed)

Cache persists:
- Across multiple file operations
- For entire application session
- Until restart or config change
```

**Performance Improvement:**

```
Scenario: Upload 50 receipts

Without Cache:
- 50 × (1 drives query + 1 upload) = 100 API calls
- Time: ~30 seconds

With Cache:
- 1 drives query + 50 uploads = 51 API calls
- Time: ~8 seconds
- Improvement: 73% faster
```

### 5.6 Troubleshooting SharePoint Issues

#### Common Errors

**Error: Site Not Found**

```
Message: "Invalid SharePoint site URL"
Cause: Site doesn't exist or inaccessible
Fix:
1. Verify URL is correct
2. Open URL in browser - does it load?
3. Check you have permissions
4. Ensure HTTPS protocol
5. Include trailing slash
```

## 6. Vocabulary Customization

### 6.1 Understanding the Vocabulary System

**Purpose:**

SCDP uses hierarchical terminology to organize project work:

```
Epic (Top Level)
├── Stage (Middle Level)
    └── Activity (Detail Level)

Workstream (Cross-cutting)
Milestone (Gates/Payments)
```

**Problem:** Different clients use different terms for the same concepts.

**Solution:** Customizable vocabulary at three levels.

---

### 6.2 Vocabulary Catalog Management

**System Terms:**

![Vocabulary Catalog](screenshots/admin-05-vocab-catalog.png)

**Creating Custom Terms:**

```
Example: Adding "Sprint" as a Stage alternative

1. Navigate to System Settings → Vocabulary Catalog
2. Click "Add Term"
3. Enter:
   Term Type: stage
   Term Value: Sprint
   Description: Agile sprint (2-week iteration)
   Sort Order: 5
   Is Active: ✅
4. Click "Save"

Result: "Sprint" now available as Stage option
```

**Pre-Loaded Terms:**

```
Epic Alternatives:
- Epic (default)
- Program
- Release
- Initiative
- Theme
- Phase
- Module

Stage Alternatives:
- Stage (default)
- Phase
- Sprint
- Iteration
- Cycle
- Stream
- Step

Activity Alternatives:
- Activity (default)
- Task
- Work Item
- Story
- Deliverable
- Ticket
- Job

Workstream Alternatives:
- Workstream (default)
- Track
- Stream
- Discipline
- Capability
- Domain

Milestone Alternatives:
- Milestone (default)
- Gate
- Checkpoint
- Review
- Phase Gate
- Deliverable
```

---

### 6.3 Organization-Level Defaults

**Setting Organization Vocabulary:**

![Organization Vocab](screenshots/admin-05-vocab-org.png)

```
Scenario: Agile organization wants Agile terminology by default

Configuration:
1. Navigate to System Settings → Organization Vocabulary
2. Select defaults:
   Epic: Theme
   Stage: Sprint
   Activity: Story
   Workstream: Discipline
   Milestone: Review
3. Click "Save Organization Defaults"

Result:
- All new clients use these terms by default
- All new projects use these terms
- All new estimates default to these
```

**When to Set:**
- Initial system setup
- Organization-wide methodology change
- Rebranding/terminology shift

**Impact:**
- Affects all future records
- Doesn't change existing data
- Clients/projects can still override

---

### 6.4 Client-Specific Overrides

**Why Override for Clients:**

```
Scenario 1: Client uses Waterfall
Organization Default: Theme, Sprint, Story (Agile)
Client: Traditional Corp
Override: Phase, Deliverable, Task (Waterfall)

Scenario 2: Client uses SAFe
Organization Default: Epic, Stage, Activity
Client: Enterprise Agile Shop
Override: PI, Iteration, Feature (SAFe)
```

**Setting Client Vocabulary:**

![Client Vocab](screenshots/admin-05-vocab-client.png)

```
Process:
1. Open client: Traditional Corp
2. Navigate to Vocabulary tab
3. Select overrides:
   Epic: Phase
   Stage: Deliverable
   Activity: Task
   (Leave Workstream and Milestone as org defaults)
4. Click "Save"

Result:
- All projects for this client use these terms
- All estimates for this client use these terms
- Only this client affected
```

---

### 6.5 Project-Specific Overrides

**Rare Use Cases:**

```
Example: Client normally uses Agile, but one project is Waterfall

Client Default: Theme, Sprint, Story
Project: Legacy System Migration (Waterfall)
Project Override: Phase, Deliverable, Task

Configuration:
1. Open project: Legacy System Migration
2. Navigate to Vocabulary tab
3. Override:
   Epic: Phase
   Stage: Deliverable
   Activity: Task
4. Save

Result: Only this project uses Waterfall terms
```

**When to Use:**
- Special project methodology
- Client pilot of new approach
- Temporary exception
- Compliance requirement

**When Not to Use:**
- Most projects (use client-level)
- Consistent methodology
- Standard engagements

---

### 6.6 Vocabulary Best Practices

**Do:**
- ✅ Set organization defaults that match your primary methodology
- ✅ Use client-level overrides for clients with different terminology
- ✅ Document why specific vocabulary is used
- ✅ Train users on vocabulary selection
- ✅ Be consistent within an organization level

**Don't:**
- ❌ Change vocabulary frequently (confuses users)
- ❌ Use project-level overrides excessively
- ❌ Create too many custom terms (keep it simple)
- ❌ Mix methodologies without reason
- ❌ Change vocabulary on active projects (confusing)

**Communication:**
- Explain vocabulary to new team members
- Note client preferences in client record
- Include vocabulary guide in proposals
- Align internal and external terminology

## 12. Best Practices

### 12.1 Security Best Practices

**Password Policy:**

```
Requirements:
├─ Minimum 12 characters
├─ Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
├─ No common passwords
├─ No reuse of last 5 passwords
├─ Change every 90 days (recommended)
└─ MFA enforced (production)

Implementation:
- SSO handles password policy (Microsoft Azure AD)
- Development mode has basic validation
- Encourage use of password managers
```

**Access Reviews:**

```
Quarterly Review:
1. Export all user accounts
2. For each user:
   □ Still employed?
   □ Role still appropriate?
   □ Login still needed?
   □ Assignments still active?
3. Deactivate as needed
4. Document review
5. Report to management
```

**Principle of Least Privilege:**

```
Rules:
├─ Users get minimum role needed
├─ Temporary access is time-limited
├─ Admin role only for administrators
├─ PM role only for project managers
├─ Review permissions quarterly

Examples:
❌ Don't: Give everyone PM role "just in case"
✅ Do: Give employee role, promote when needed

❌ Don't: Make everyone admin for testing
✅ Do: Create test accounts with appropriate roles

❌ Don't: Leave contractors as full employees
✅ Do: Set Can Login=false when contract ends
