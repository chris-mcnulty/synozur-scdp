/**
 * Task #142 — Galaxy + LWW regression suite entrypoint.
 *
 * Run with: `npm test` (or `npx tsx tests/run.ts`).
 *
 * All spec files register tests via the shared harness in `_harness.ts` at
 * module load. After every spec is imported we invoke `run()` once. The
 * harness sets `process.exitCode = 1` when any test fails, so a single
 * failing case in any suite causes `npm test` to exit non-zero — no suite
 * can mask a regression in another.
